Here is a sampling of my data projects, both from my academic coursework and personal side projects. All project repos can be found on my GitHub page, https://github.com/KatDevlin. Note: some of the projects contain Chinese metadata. That's because my computer settings are in Chinese. Shouldn't affect anything else.

## [Principal Components Analysis in R](https://katdevlin.github.io/PCA_cars/)

- An RMarkdown project using PCA to analyze the built-in R dataset, mtcars

## [Cluster Analysis in R](https://katdevlin.github.io/ClusterAnalysis_colleges/)

- An RMarkdown project for my graduate multivariate statistics course, examining various metrics of American universities
- Methods include cluster analysis with various distance measures and k-means

## [Prediction Modeling in R](https://katdevlin.github.io/predict_2000election/)

- An RMarkdown project for a graduate data analysis/stats course
- Data transformations, linear models and some predictions looking at county voting patterns in Florida for the 2000 presidential election

## [Web Scrape in R](https://katdevlin.github.io/housing_scrape/)

- An RMarkdown homework assignment looking at a New Haven property database that I've rejiggered with updated data and code
- In addition to the scrape, I use a for loop and gsub/grep to create a clean .csv file that can be used for further analysis 
- The original database, in all its clunky glory, can be found at: http://gis.vgsi.com/newhavenct/

## [Data Analysis in R](https://katdevlin.github.io/OlympicDives/)

- An RMarkdown compilation of homework assignments looking at scores from the 2000 Olympics' diving competition
- Paired data visualizations with actual statistical analysis to backup hunches from the graphs
