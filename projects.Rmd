Here is a sampling of my data projects, both from my academic coursework and personal side projects. 

## [Principal Components Analysis in R](https://katdevlin.github.io/pcaCars/)

- An RMarkdown project using PCA to analyze the built-in R dataset, mtcars.
- Includes a github repo for access to all the code.
