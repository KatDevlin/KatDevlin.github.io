I am a research associate at the Pew Research Center’s [Global Attitudes Project](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/), where I specialize in international public opinion and quantitative research methods. Links to my writing are below.  

Previously, I earned my master’s degree from Yale University’s [Jackson Institute for Global Affairs](https://jackson.yale.edu/), with concentrations in quantitative research and Chinese studies. I also served as a Fulbright grantee in Malaysia.
