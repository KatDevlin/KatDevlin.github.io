A native of South Jersey, I enjoy books, vegetarian cooking and the perpetual heartache of being a Philadelphia sports fan.

At Yale, I concentrated in quanatitative research methods/applied statistics. This included working in R, Stata, Excel and some Python. I also studied Chinese and looked at maps (below, center).
